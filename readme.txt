BUILDING
Open ElexKeyBinder.lpr in Lazarus 2.0.12 or later. Click Run -> Build.
Should also work in previous Lazarus versions with small adjustments.

USAGE
Before making any changes, press "Open Folder" button and backup "Action_Map_User_01.xam" and "Action_Map_User_02.xam" files in case something goes wrong. You can also revert all controls to their defaults. 
It is recommended to close the game before running the program. Changes you made will not take place while the game is running. 
To clear a key, press "X" button next to it.
The program will let you save any crazy binds, since I can't try every possible combination of set / unbound keys. Possibly problematic overlaps will be highlighted. Don't worry much about breaking things though, you can always Alt+F4 out of the game and change everything.
Due to certain limitations you can't set Num Enter directly, press Ctrl+E to do so.
Menu click is set to left mouse button and cannot be changed. Menu scroll is set to mouse wheel up/down and also cannot be changed. Be careful using these buttons for other menu actions.
When you change movement controls in-game, it overwrites respective Menu Up, Down, Left or Right controls.
